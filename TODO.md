# Phase 2

#### Ingredient screen improvements

Option to add from receipt (OCR).  
Time machine (see ingredients during a time range).

#### Custom status

Phase 1 manages status automatically. Last cooked recipe is auto-set as the current status. Phase 2 to have an option to set a custom status text & pic (a la WhatsApp).

#### Cook along

Option to set photo status at each step of recipe instructions. Friends/followers to be able to get "live" status update about the recipe being played/cooked. This feature will help in creating **food influencers**.

# Phase 3

#### Ingredients from photo

Use image classification to identify ingredient names (and possibly quantities) from photo clicked from camera.

#### Karaoke-style play/cook screen

Playing a recipe will be like playing a song in karaoke mode (more precisely like lyrics mode in Apple Music).
