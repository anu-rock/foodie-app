  - [x] find recipes by ingredients
  - [x] add recipe (automatically done by viewing a recipe the first time from search results)
  - [x] get recipe by id/title
  - [x] get popular recipes
- [x] Status repository
  - [x] now playing recipe (Ã  la Steam)
- [ ] Log respository
  - [ ] recipe search
  - [ ] errors (https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/maintenance/error-reporting)
- [ ] Push Notifications (use Firebase Functions)
  - [ ] status updates for friends
  - [ ] new follower
- [ ] Email Notifications (use Firebase Functions)
  - [ ] email verification
  - [ ] welcome email
  - [ ] password reset
  - [ ] all push notification scenarios
- [ ] Facebook login
- [x] iOS support (Firebase and smoke testing)

## Tests

- [ ] More screen/widget tests
  - [ ] Widget tests for `RecipeOverviewScreen`
    - is recipe displayed when coming from search screen?
    - is recipe displayed when coming from some other screen?
    - is favorite button visible?
    - is total favorites for recipe data visible?
- [ ] More integration tests

## CI/CD

- [x] Build automation

# Phase 2

#### Ingredient screen improvements

Option to add from receipt (OCR).  
Time machine (see ingredients during a time range).

#### Custom status

Phase 1 manages status automatically. Last cooked recipe is auto-set as the current status. Phase 2 to have an option to set a custom status text & pic (a la WhatsApp).

#### Status interactions

Ability to comment on and like status updates of followees.

#### Cook along

Option to set photo status at each step of recipe instructions. Friends/followers to be able to get "live" status update about the recipe being played/cooked. This feature will help in creating **food influencers**.

#### Google signup/login

Add Google as a new authentication method, alongside Email and Facebook.

#### More discovery options

For now the Discover screen shows only popular (most cooked) recipes. Add more discovery options. For example:

- most favorited recipes
- most viewed recipes
- popular in your network
- top ingredients

#### Sync user profile details

Keep user's profile details such as display name and photo url always in sync using a Firebase Function.

# Phase 3

#### Ingredients from photo

Use image classification to identify ingredient names (and possibly quantities) from photo clicked from camera.

#### Karaoke-style play/cook screen

Playing a recipe will be like playing a song in karaoke mode (more precisely like lyrics mode in Apple Music).
